##  :beginner: Introduction
In the field of data analysis, time series forecasting plays a significant role in predicting future trends and patterns.
Univariate time series analysis is a popular technique that focuses on predicting the future values of a single variable over a period of time. 
In this project, we will use Python to perform univariate time series forecasting, utilizing various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, 
and exponential smoothing. Our aim is to analyze the historical data available in the dataset and develop a model that accurately predicts the 
future values of the variable. The repository for this project is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/iamkkmcmd/TSA"> here </a>.
